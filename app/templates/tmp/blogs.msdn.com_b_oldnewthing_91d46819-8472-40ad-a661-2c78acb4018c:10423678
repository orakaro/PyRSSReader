Now that we've had
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/04/10423296.aspx">
a quick introduction to asynchronous input</a>,
let's look at some of the details.
Remember,
<b>this is
<a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/qaaboutrhetoric/f/QAmixmetaphor.htm">
a peek under the hood at how the sausage is made</a></b>.
The algorithm described here is not part of the API contract
and it can change at any time,
as long as it services the overall goal of serializing input.
</p>
<p>
Let's start by looking at how things worked in the 16-bit world.
Even though 16-bit Windows didn't use the term <i>thread</i>
(since each application was single-threaded),
I will still use the term since that makes the transition to the
32-bit world more straightforward.
</p>
<p>
As a point of terminology,
I say that a message <i>belongs to</i> a thread
if the message targets a window which belongs to that thread.
Equivalently, the thread <i>owns</i> the message.
</p>
<p>
Now, the goal is to dispatch
input messages in chronological order:
Only the thread which owns the next input message can retrieve it.
All other input must wait their turn to come to the front of the
input queue.
</p>
<p>
In 16-bit Windows, all input gets added to a system-wide input
queue, and
the basic algorithm used by
<code>Peek&shy;Message</code> and <code>Get&shy;Message</code>
for retrieving messages from the input queue
goes like this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the first message in the input queue:
    <ul>
    <li>If the message belongs to some other thread,
        then stop. Return no message to the caller.
    <li>Otherwise,
        return the message we found.
    </ul>
<li>If there are no messages in the input queue, then
    there is no input.
    Return no message.
</ul>
<p>
All the rest is tweaking the boundary cases.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose there are two input messages in the input queue,
message&nbsp;1 for thread&nbsp;A,
and message&nbsp;2 for thread&nbsp;B.
Thread&nbsp;A calls <code>Get&shy;Message</code>,
and the above algorithm returns message&nbsp;1 to thread&nbsp;A,
at which point the new "first message" is message&nbsp;2,
and if thread&nbsp;B calls
<code>Get&shy;Message</code>,
it will get message&nbsp;2.
</p>
<p>
The catch is that according to the above algorithm,
thread&nbsp;B can be told about message&nbsp;2
<i>before thread&nbsp;A has finished processing message&nbsp;1</i>.
You've introduced a race condition that breaks the rule that
input is processed sequentially:
Thread&nbsp;B can race ahead of thread&nbsp;A and start processing
message&nbsp;2 before thread&nbsp;A can even get started processing
message&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>
To fix this, we add a new state to the input queue that says
"Yea, I just gave somebody an input message,
and I'm waiting for that thread to finish processing it before
I will hand out another input message."
</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue">(New!)
    If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message, then stop and return no message.</font>
<li><font color="blue">(New!)
    If the input queue is waiting for the current thread to
    finish processing an input message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting. (We finished processing
    it and have come back for more!)</font>
<li>Look at the first message in the input queue:
    <ul>
    <li>If the message belongs to some other thread,
        then stop. Return no message to the caller.
    <li>Otherwise,
        <font color="blue">(New!)
        mark the input queue as waiting for the current
        thread to finish processing an input message</font>,
        and return the message we found.
    </ul>
<li>If there are no messages in the input queue, then
    there is no input. Return no message.
</ul>
<p>
Okay, we fixed a race condition.
But now there's a new problem:
Suppose thread&nbsp;A retrieves an input message
(and therefore puts the input queue into the
"waiting for thread&nbsp;A" state),
and then thread&nbsp;A sends a message to thread&nbsp;B,
and thread&nbsp;B wants to display a dialog box or a menu.
According to the rules as we have them so far,
we would have a deadlock:
That <code>Send&shy;Message</code> call will not return to the
first thread until the modal UI is complete,
but the modal UI cannot complete because the input queue
is waiting for thread&nbsp;A to finish processing the input message.
</p>
<p>
The fix for this special case is that if a thread asks for
an input message,
and it is handling an inbound <code>Send&shy;Message</code>,
then the input queue declares that any in-progress input message
has finished processing.
One way of interpreting this rule is to say,
"If a thread sends a message to another thread,
then that implicitly completes input processing."
</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue">(New!)
    If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message,
    and the current thread is processing an inbound sent message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting.</font>
<li>If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message, then stop and return no message.
<li>If the input queue is waiting for the current thread to
    finish processing an input message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting.
<li>Look at the first message in the input queue:
    <ul>
    <li>If the message belongs to some other thread,
        then stop. Return no message to the caller.
    <li>Otherwise,
        mark the input queue as waiting for the current
        thread to finish processing an input message,
        and return the message we found.
    </ul>
<li>If there are no messages in the input queue, then
    there is no input. Return no message.
</ul>
<p>
Recall that
you are allowed to pass a message range filter
and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/03/22/10404367.aspx">
a window handle filter</a>
to the
<code>Peek&shy;Message</code> and
<code>Get&shy;Message</code> functions.
The above algorithm was developed on the assumption that
there was no message retrieval filter.
First, let's add the message range filter to the algorithm:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message,
    and the current thread is processing an inbound sent message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting.
<li>If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message, then stop and return no message.
<li>If the input queue is waiting for the current thread to
    finish processing an input message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting.
<li>Look at the first message in the input queue
    <font color="blue">which satisfies the message range filter (New!)</font>:
    <ul>
    <li>If the message belongs to some other thread,
        then stop. Return no message to the caller.
    <li>Otherwise,
        mark the input queue as waiting for the current
        thread to finish processing an input message,
        and return the message we found.
    </ul>
<li>If there are no messages in the input queue
    <font color="blue">which satisfy the message range filter (New!)</font>,
    then there is no input. Return no message.
</ul>
<p>
That wasn't so hard.
If you pass a message range filter, then we care only about
messages that pass the filter in determining which one is "at
the head of the input queue".
Without this additional rule, you wouldn't be able to
"peek into the future" to see if, for example, there is
a mouse message in the input queue sitting behind the keyboard message
that is at the front of the input queue.
</p>
<p>
Adding the window handle filter is a little trickier,
because
we still want to let input be processed in order
(among messages which satisfy the message range filter).
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message,
    and the current thread is processing an inbound sent message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting.
<li>If the input queue is waiting for another thread to finish
    processing an input message, then stop and return no message.
<li>If the input queue is waiting for the current thread to
    finish processing an input message,
    then mark the input queue as no longer waiting.
<li>Look at the first message in the input queue which
    satisfies the message range filter and
    <font color="blue">(New!) either belongs to some other thread
    or belongs to the current thread and matches the
    window handle filter</font>.
    <ul>
    <li>If the message belongs to some other thread,
        then stop. Return no message to the caller.
    <li>Otherwise,
        mark the input queue as waiting for the current
        thread to finish processing an input message,
        and return the message we found.
    </ul>
<li>If no such message exists,
    then there is no input. Return no message.
</ul>
<p>
In other words,
the window handle is used to control
which message is ultimately retrieved,
but it does not let you deny another thread access to input
which matches the message range filter.
</p>
<p>
Whew,
that's how 16-bit Windows dispatched input.
</p>
<p>
How do we port this to 32-bit Windows and asynchronous input?
</p>
<p>
First, we give each thread group its own input queue,
rather than having a single system-wide input queue.
</p>
<p>
Second, whenever the above algorithm says <i>the input queue</i>,
change it to say
<i>the calling thread's input queue</i>.
</p>
<p>
And that's it!
</p>
<p>
In the absence of thread attachment, each thread has its own
input queue,
so most of the above rules have no effect.
For example,
You will never see a message that belongs to another thread,
because messages that belong to other threads go into
those other threads' input queues, not yours.
You will never find that your input queue is waiting for another thread,
because no other threads have access to your input queue.
In the case where there is only one thread associated with an
input queue, the algorithm simplifies to
</p>
<ul>
<li>Return the first message in the input queue
    that satisfies both the message range filter
    and the window handle filter, if any.
</ul>
<p>
It's only if you start attaching threads to each other
that you have multiple threads associated with a single input queue,
and then all these extra rules start to have an effect.
</p>
<p>
Next time, we'll explore some of the consequences of synchronous input
by writing some poorly-behaving code and observing how the system responds.
Along the way, we'll discover an interesting paradox
introduced by the above algorithm.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
The alternative interpretation I gave above does not match
the description of the rule,
because the rule allows <i>any</i> thread processing an inbound
<code>Send&shy;Message</code> to clear the input queue's wait state.
Why does the actual rule permit any thread clear the wait state,
instead of first checking that the inbound
<code>Send&shy;Message</code> is coming from the thread that the
input queue is waiting for?
