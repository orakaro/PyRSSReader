Commenter BAA says that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/16/10256947.aspx#10257580">
the -lett part of Marlett comes from the designer Virginia Howlett</a>.
BAA adds, "I forget the 'Mar' but I believe it was a co-creator."
</p>
<p>
If so, then that co-creator was Suzan <u>Mar</u>ashi,
if
Vincent Connare is to be trusted.
On page 17 of the PDF document
<a href="http://www.connare.com/darkside.pdf"><i>From The Dark Side...</i></a>,
Connare identifies the authors of the font as
Virginia Howlett, Rom Impas, Suzan Marashi, and Alison Grauman-Barnes.
He also identifies Eliyezer Kohen as the person whose idea it was
to use a special-purpose font.

According to Virginia Howlett,
the original name for the font Verdana was
<a href="http://www.dmxzone.com/go?6669&amp;LinkFile=page2.htm">
Ventana</a>,
which means <i>window</i> in Spanish.
Lawyers apparently objected to the name,
and the font team explored variations on
<i lang="es">verde</i> (which means <i>green</i> in Spanish)
and
<i>verdigris</i> (a green pigment),
thereby invoking the color associated both with Washington
(<i>The Evergreen State</i></a>)
and Seattle
(<i>The Emerald City</i>).
The second part of the font name comes from Howlett's granddaughter Ana,
following in the tradition of font designers naming fonts after their
daughters.
