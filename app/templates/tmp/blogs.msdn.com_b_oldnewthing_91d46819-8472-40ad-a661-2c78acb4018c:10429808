    Personally, I jump right to step 5:
    "Just assume it's a fake."

    <a href="http://venturevillage.eu/how-to-be-german-part-1">
    How to be German</a>.
    Though I think the author is too harsh on German grammar.
    German grammar rigidly follows the rules,
    just like the German people.
    Why the surprise?
    (For me, learning German was the opposite of the author's experience.
    Learning the rules was fun. Learning words was boring.)

    I remember reading the minutes of meetings of the Royal Society

    A lot of the entries were of the form

    No change was observed."
    Even if Y = a mouse.

    Twice a year,
    fans of Disneyland choose a day to show up at the park
    <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-dapper-20130326-dto,0,2190196.htmlstory">
    smartly dressed</a> in vintage fashion inspired by the illustrations
    of park guests in the 1950's.
    They call it
    <a href="http://www.dapperday.com/">Dapper Day</a>.
    Here are some pictures from
    <a href="http://www.dapperday.com/index.php?/dapper-day/2013-event-photos/">
    Spring 2013</a>.
    Maybe next time, I'll wear a suit to Disneyland.
    I have a few to choose from.

    Last year,
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/06/29/10325296.aspx">
    I linked to</a>
    <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/02/conspiracy-uber-alles.html">
    Conspiracy &Uuml;ber Alles</a>,
    a research result that shows that once you entertain one
    conspiracy theory, you start to take them all,
    even if they are contradictory.
    This year, we get to observe the inevitable consequences:
    <a href="http://blogs.agu.org/wildwildscience/2013/03/27/how-not-to-prove-youre-not-wearing-a-tin-foil-hat/">
    Conspiracy theorists are convinced that a research paper
    critical of conspiracy theorists is part of a conspiracy</a>.
    Naturally, the researchers analyzed the angry responses to their
    original paper and
    <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/Recursive-Fury-Facts-misrepresentations.html">
    published a new paper</a>
    aptly titled
    <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Personality_Science_and_Individual_Differences/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00073/full">

    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/business/sham-shareholder-democracy.html?_r=0">
    Elections for directors of public companies are a sham</a>.
    In 2012, every single director who failed to be re-elected
    remained on the board anyway.
    One time, a company called me to say,
    "Our records show that you have not sent in your vote.
    Please do so, so that we can hold our annual meeting."
    I explained, "Yes, I am withholding my vote on purpose.
    Preventing a quorum
    is the only way I can prevent the current board of directors
    from being re-elected."

    disposable chopsticks are made</a>.
    The part of the process where my jaw dropped was at timecode
    7:30, where all the chopsticks are just dumped into <i>huge piles</i>,
    and then human beings sort through them for quality control.
    Certainly they can automate this part, too?
